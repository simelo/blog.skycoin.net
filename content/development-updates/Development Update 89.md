## Fixes:

Fixed dozens of bugs with the crypto library port.

The sipa and gocoin libsecp256k1 implementation differ slightly and output different public keys for the same private key for some inputs (every few thousand keys).

Slightly different public keys are outputted for the same secret key.

The only contractor who knows what library is doing, cant/wont help because it is too time consuming. It took about 6000 lines of unit tests (almost larger than skycoin), just to find all the bugs. I cannot release it until the unit tests for deterministic wallet generation pass.

If you raise the same base point to the same power, you should get the same public key. It should not differ between implementations, for some small subset of keys.
