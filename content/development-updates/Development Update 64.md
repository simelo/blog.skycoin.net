##### Skycoin Merkle-dag system is based upon this.
- A directory is a list of nodes. The id of the node is the hash of its serialization
- Each node is either a folder or a file.

- The owner signs the root hash with their private key

- The directory is referenced by a

Users can update the files after they upload them. If you have a javascript file, instead of rerequesting the file from the server, everytime the page is loaded, the file is named by its hash. If the hash is in the local cache, it does not need to redownload it.

- A stripped down version of IPFS using skycoin cryptography primitives
- Tuns over Skywire
