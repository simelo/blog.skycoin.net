For Skycoin:
- finish exchange architecture (mostly boiler plate)
- get meshnet routing algorithm working (there is some R&D here)
- wrap a VPN frontend and then get it working on OSX and Windows

The angular 2.0 compilation/gulp setup is done and will use this as a pseudo terminal for now. I think this will be satisfactory for the interface.
