## Coin Status:

Dozens of bug fixes on the CLI and WebRPC interface. The OSX wallet directory bug is fixed now.

I have been using CLI interface a lot.

## Meshnet:

Three tasks left then we are onto info graphics and marketing. We do not have a user interface yet but back end will be working.

## Marketing:

We are trying to get full time person to manage the social media accounts, marketing and user community.

## Coin Checklist:

The remaining items for the coin are:
- The three white papers
- Blockchain explorer interface
- Minor bugs and usability improvements in the wallet

I want to get the coin out of the way and be at 100% launch readiness. All of the APIs are in place to do an internal market.

Then will start pushing out the application software, ecosystem stuff and begin selling the dream.
