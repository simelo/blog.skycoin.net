## New Wallet Version:

Skycoin Wallet version 15 is on the website, which fixes dozens of UI bugs.
- Transaction status should be working
- There is a combined installer for Windows 32/64 bit now
- The windows path issue was fixed
- Peer to peer connections and PEX (peer exchange) are enabled now

There is a huge back log of improvements on the wallet we are working through.

We have to decide what we will focus on for the next push
- Marketing / Infographics / Videos / Transslatoin
- 2.0 wallet, wallet usability improvements and QA
- Release of demo applications for the skycoin network
