# CX Introduction

CX is both a specification and  a programming language designed to
embrace a new programming paradigm based on the concept of
affordances. Affordances allow a program to know what actions can and
cannnot be done by it. For example, we can ask the program what
arguments can be sent to a function, and the program will return a
list of possible actions. After having decided what action from the
list is appropriate, we can choose one of the options and the program
will apply the chosen action. As a consequence of CX's affordance system, a
genetic programming algorithm is built and provided as a native
function, which can be used to optimize the program's structure during
runtime.

The CX specification states that both a compiler and an interpreter
must be accessible to the programmer. The interpreter can be accessed
through a read-eval-print loop, where the programmer can interactively
add and remove elements to a program. Once the program has been
finished, it can be compiled in order to increase its performance.

The typing system in CX is very strict. The only "implicit casting"
occurs when the parser determines what is an integer, a float, a
boolean, a string, or an array. If a function requires a 64 bit
integer, for example, one has to use a cast function to explicitly
convert it to the required type.

Lastly, a CX program can be completely serialized to byte arrays,
maintaining its execution state and structure. This serialized version
of a program can be deserialized later on, and continue its execution
in any device that has a CX interpreter/compiler.

In the following sections, the CX features discussed in the above
paragraphs are described in more detail.

# Project's Repository

The source code of the project can be downloaded from its Github
repository:
[https://github.com/skycoin/cx](https://github.com/skycoin/cx). The
repository includes the specification file, documentation, examples,
and the source code itself.

# Syntax

As was mentioned in the introduction, CX is both a specification and a
programming language. The CX specification does not impose a syntax,
but rather the structures and processes that a CX dialect must
implement in order to be considered a CX. As a consequence, one could
implement a two CX dialects, one with a Lisp-like syntax, and another
one with a C-like syntax. This underlaying language is called CX Base,
or "the base language." In this document, an implementation is used to
showcase the capabilities of the specification, although its purpose
is not only to serve as an academic tool, but to become a complete and
robust language that can be used for general purposes.

The CX used in this document has the goal to have a syntax as similar
as possible to Go's syntax.

# Affordances

A programmer needs to make a plethora of decisions while constructing
a program, e.g., how many parameters a function must receive, how many
parameters it must return, what statements are needed to obtain the
desired functionality, and what arguments need to be sent as
parameters to the statement functions, among others. The affordance
system in CX can be queried to obtain a list of the possible actions
that can be applied to an element. In this context, examples of elements are
functions, structs, modules, and expressions.

Without having a set of rules and facts that dictate what must be the
logic and purpose behind a program, one can determine some basic
restrictions that, at least, guarantee that a program will be
semantically correct. The affordance system provides such restrictions
as the first filtering layer, and are explained below.

### Arity Restrictions

Expressions in CX can return multiple values. This creates a challenge
for the affordance system, as the number of variables that receive
the output arguments of an expression need to match the number of
outputs defined by the expression's operator.

```
out1, out2, ..., outN := op(inp1, inp2, ..., inpM)
```

If the example above is correct, then *op* needs to output *N*
arguments. This problem can become even more challenging if we
consider that *op*'s definition can be changed by the affordance
system itself or by the user in the future: as soon as *op*'s
definition changes, new affordances can be applied to any expression
which uses *op* as its operator, because the number of variables that
receive *op*'s output arguments are now in mismatch.

The previous logic also implies that if the number of receiving
variables matches the number of output parameters of the expression's
operator, the action of adding new receiving variables can no longer
be performed.

Arity restrictions also apply to input arguments in expressions, i.e.,
if a function call has already all of its input arguments defined,
then the affordance system should not enlist adding another argument
as a possible action. Likewise, if an expression is trying to call an
operator with fewer arguments than the required, the affordance
system, when queried, should tell the programmer that adding a new
argument to the function call is possible.

**Example:**

*Note: string concatenation has not been implemented yet. Also, the
print functions always append a newline at the end of the string being
printed. A future version of the CX implementation presented in this
document will address these issues.*

```
var age i32 = 18
var steps i32 = 23

func advance (direction str, numberSteps i32) () {
    printStr("Advancing:")
    printStr(direction)
    printStr("Number of steps:")
    printI32(numberSteps)
}

func main () () {
    advance("North")
}
```

In the example above, the call to *advance* in the *main* function
lacks one argument. If one queries the affordance system, the system
should enlist, among other things, an action similar to:

```
...
(k)       AddArgument advance age
(k+1)     AddArgument advance steps
...
```

where k represents an arbitrary index. As one can see, the affordance
system is telling the programmer that two of the possible actions that
can be done are to add another argument to the advance function, and
the global definitions *age* and *steps* are among the options to act
as arguments.

It is noteworthy to mention that affordances should always be
enumerated, and their order should be constant over several calls to
the affordance system. The reason behind this is that the programmer
should be able to indicate the system what affordance is to be applied
after examining the query's result.

### Type Restrictions

The common behaviour in programming languages is to have a typing system
which restricts the programmer from sending arguments of unexpected
types to function calls. Even in weakly typed programming languages,
an operation such as `true / "hello world"` should raise an error
(unless in the case of an
[esoteric language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language),
of course). CX follows a very
[strict typing system](#strict-typing-system), and arguments that are
not exactly of the expected type should not be considered as
candidates for affordances' actions (although a workaround is to wrap
these arguments in cast functions before being shown as affordances).

Type restrictions must also be considered when assigning a new value
to an already existant variable. In CX, a variable declared of a
certain type must remain of that type during all of its lifetime
(unless it is removed using meta-programming commands/functions and
created anew). Thus, a variable declared to hold a 32 bit integer should not
be considered as a candidate to receive a 64 bit float output
argument, for example.

### Existential Restrictions

This type of restriction can seem trivial at first sight: if an
element does not exist, an affordance that involves it should not
exist either. Nevertheless, this restriction becomes a challenge once
we consider a situation where a function was renamed, and it has
already been used as an operator in expressions throughout a
program. If the program is in its source code form, this problem is
reduced to a simple "search & replace" process, but if it's during
runtime, the affordance system becomes very useful: an affordance
to change the identifier bound to this operator.

Even if an element has not be renamed, determining if an element
exists or not is not trivial. The elements to be used in affordances
must be searched in the call stack's current scope, in the global
scope, and in other modules' global scopes.

### Identifier Restrictions

Adding new named elements are commonly candidate actions for affordances. A
restriction that arises when trying to apply such type of affordance
is to ensure a unique identifier for the new element to avoid
redefinitions. The affordance system can either generate a unique
identifier in the element's scope, or can ask the programmer to
provide a suitable identifier.

### Boundaries Restrictions

CX provides native functions for accessing and modifying elements from
arrays. Examples of an array reader and an array writer are:


```
readI32([]i32{0, 10, 20, 30}, 3)
writeF32([]f32{0.0, 10.10, 20.20}, 1, 5.5)
```

In the first expression, an array of four 32 bit integers is accessed
at index 3, which returns the last element of the array. In the second
expression, the second element of an array of three 32 bit floats is
changed to 5.5. If any of these arrays was accessed using either a
negative index or an index which exceeds the length of the array, an
"out of boundaries" error is raised.

By obeying only the type restrictions, the affordance system will tell
the programmer that any 32 bit integer argument can be used as an
index to access any array. Although these programs would compile, out
of boundaries errors are very probable to occur if the programmer does not
pay extra attention to what is being chosen to be applied.

The affordance system needs to filter the affordances according to the
following criteria: discard any negative 32 bit integer, and discard
any 32 bit integer which exceeds the length of the array being sent to
the array reader or writer.

### User-defined Restrictions
*Note: The user-defined restrictions system is still in its
 experimental stages.*

The basic restrictions described above should at least guarantee that
the program does not encounter any runtime errors. These restrictions
should be enough to build some interesting systems, such as CX's
native
[evolutionary algorithm](#integrated-evolutionary-algorithm). Nevertheless,
in some situations a more robust system is required. For this purpose,
clauses, queries and objects are used to describe a module's
environment. These elements are defined by using an integrated Prolog
interpreter, and the CX native functions *setClauses*, *setQuery*, and
*addObject*.

The most general description of this restriction system is that the
programmer defines a series of Prolog clauses (facts and rules), that
will be queried using the defined Prolog query, for each of the
objects added. This will hardly make any sense to anyone reading this
for the first time. An example should clarify the concepts and the
process a bit more:

```
setClauses("move(robot, north, X, R) :- X = northWall, R = false.")

setQuery("move(robot, %s, %s, R).")
```

In this example, only one rule is defined. The rule can roughly be
interpreted as "if the robot wants to move north, ask what is X. If X
is northWall, then it can't move." The query is just a format string
that will serve as a query for the *move* action, and for the *robot*
element that will receive two more arguments: a direction, and an
object.

Objects can be defined by using the *addObject* function:

```
addObject("southWall")
addObject("northWall")
```

The restriction system will query the system for each of the objects
present in the module. In this example, the system will first perform
the query "move(robot, north, southWall)," and the system will respond
"nil," which means that it does not have any rule defined to handle
such situation, and the default action is to not discard the
affordance. The second query will be "move(robot, north, northWall),"
and the system will respond "false." In this case, the affordance did
not pass the test, and is discarded.

The example above illustrates how these rules can negate an
affordance using a condition. But rules can also be used to accept
affordances, even after being negated by previous rules.

```
setClauses("move(robot, north, X, R) :- X = northWall, R = false.
    move(robot, north, X, R) :- X = northWormhole, R = true.")

setQuery("move(robot, %s, %s, R).")
```

The added rule in the code above tells the system to accept the robot
movement towards north if a wormhole is present. If the object array
is left as it was defined before, the movement affordance will still
be discarded, but if `addObject("northWormhole")` is evaluated, the
"northWormhole" will be added and the robot will be able to pass
through the wall using the wormhole.

# Strict Typing System

As mentioned in the introduction, there is no implicit casting in
CX. Because of this, multiple versions for each of the primitive types
are defined in the core module. For example, four native functions for
addition exist: addI32, addI64, addF32, and addF64.

The parser attaches a default type to data it finds
in the source code: if an integer is read, its default type is *i32*
or 32 bit integer; and if a float is read, its default type is *f32* or 32
bit float. There is no ambiguity with other data read by the parser:
*true* and *false* are always booleans; a series of characters
enclosed between double quotes are always strings; and array needs to
indicate its type before the list of its elements, e.g., `[]i64{1, 2,
3}`.

For the cases where the programmer needs to explicitly cast a value of
one type to another, the core module provides a number of cast
functions to work with primitive types. For example, `byteAToStr`
casts a byte array to a string, and `i32ToF32` casts a 32 bit integer
to a 32 bit float.

# Compiled and Interpreted

The CX specification enforces a CX dialect to provide the developer
with both an interpreter and a compiler. An interpreted program is far
slower than its compiled counterpart, as is expected, but will allow a
more flexible program. This flexibility comes from meta-programming
functions, and affordances, which can modify a program's structure
during runtime.

A compiled program needs a more rigid structure than an interpreted
program, as many of the optimizations leverage this rigidity. As a
consequence, the affordance system and any function that operates over
the program's structure will be limited in functionality in a compiled
program.

The compiler should be used when performance is the biggest concern,
while a program should remain being interpreted when the programmer
requires all the flexibility provided by the CX features. In the
following subsections, some of these features are presented, without
the aim of serving as a tutorial, but rather as a mere introduction.

### Read-Eval-Print Loop

The read-eval-print loop (REPL) is an interactive tool where a
programmer can input new program elements and evaluate them. Starting
a new REPL session will print the following messages to the console:

```
CX REPL
More information about CX is available at https://github.com/skycoin/cx

*
```

The "*" tells the programmer that the REPL is ready to receive a new
line of code. The REPL will keep reading input from the user until a
semicolon and a new line character are encountered.

If no program was initially loaded into the REPL, CX will start with
an empty program. This can be seen if the `:dProgram true;`
meta-programming command is given as input:


```
* :dProgram true;
Program

*
```

The REPL is only printing the word "Program" followed by an empty
line. As a first step, a new module and function can be declared:

As the first steps, a new *main* module and a new *main* function
should be declared:

```
* package main;
Program
0.- Module: main

* func main () () {};
Program
0.- Module: main
	Functions
		0.- Function: main () ()

*
```

As can be seen, the program structure is being printed every time a
new element is added to the program.

### Meta-programming Commands

`:dProgram` was used in the subsection above. Any statement that
starts with a colon (:) is part of a category of instructions known as
"meta-programming commands."

Declaring elements in the REPL instructs CX to add them to the
program's structure. But, as in many other programming languages,
these declarations are limited to only be added, and at most be
redefined.

But, as in many other programming languages that provide a REPL, the
programmer is limited to adding new elements to a program and, at
most, redefining elements. Meta-programming commands allow the
programmer to be in more control on how the program's structure is
being modified.

`:dProgram`, `:dState`, and `:dStack` are used for
debugging purposes only, by printing the program's structure, the
current call's state, and the full call stack to the user,
respectively. `:step` instructs the interpreter to go forward or
backward in its execution. `:package`, `:func`, and `:struct`, known
as *selectors*, are used to change the program's scope. `:rem` gives
the programmer access to *removers*, which can be used to selectively
remove elements from a program's structure. `:aff` is used to access
CX's affordance system; this meta-programming command is used to both
query and apply affordances for the different elements of a
program. Lastly, `:clauses` is used to set a module's clauses to be used by the
[user-defined restrictions system](#user-defined-restrictions);
`:object` and `:objects` are used for adding and printing objects,
respectively; and the last two meta-programming commands: `:query`,
which is used for setting the module's query, and `:dQuery` which is a
helper for debugging the user-defined restrictions.

### Stepping

A program started in REPL mode can be initialized with a program
structure defined in a source file. For example:
current directory

```
$ ./cx --load examples/looping.cx

```

loads `looping.cx` from the examples directory (the full list of
examples can be found in the
[project's repository](https://github.com/skycoin/cx)). Even though a
program has been loaded, it has not yet been executed. In the REPL, in
order to execute a program one has to use the meta-programming command
`:step`. To run a program until the end, `:step 0;` must be used. But
`:step` is interesting because it can take other integers as its
argument (even negative integers). For example:

```
CX REPL
More information about CX is available at https://github.com/skycoin/cx

* :dStack false;

* :step 5;
0

* :step 5;
1

* :step 5;
2

*
```

The *examples/looping.cx* program is being run 5 steps at a time. We
can see that 5 steps are required in order for the program to
re-evaluate the *while* condition, print the counter, and add 1 to the
counter.

Likewise, we should "go back in time" if the REPL is instructed to
`:step -5`.

```
...

* :step 5;
2

* :step -5;

* :step 5;
2

*
```

After instructing CX to advance 5 steps again, the 2 is printed again
to the console. It must be noted that the counter is not just being
assigned with a different value. What is happening is that the call
stack is being reverted to a previous state.

### Interactive Debugging

A CX program will enter the REPL mode once an error has been
found. This behaviour gives the programmer the opportunity to debug
the program before attempting to resume its execution.

In the example below, a division by 0 error is raised, the REPL alerts
the programmer about the error, the last call in the call stack is
dumped, and the REPL continues its execution.


```
CX REPL
More information about CX is available at https://github.com/skycoin/cx

* package main;

* func main () () {};

* :func main;
main
:func main {...
	* foo := divI32(5, 3);
main
:func main {...
	* bar := divI32(10, 0);
main
:func main {...
	* :step 0;
fn:main ln:0, 	locals:
>> 1
fn:main ln:1, 	locals: foo: 1

Call's State:
foo:		1

divI32() Arguments:
0: 10
1: 0

0: divI32: Division by 0
main
:func main {...
	*
```

Likewise, if a program is given as input to the CX interpreter,
without calling the REPL, but an error is raised, the REPL will be
called for the programmer or system administrator to debug the
program:

```
$ ./cx examples/program-halt.cx
1

Call's State:
nonAssign_0:		1
nonAssign_1:		1

divI32() Arguments:
0: 5
1: 0

5: divI32: Division by 0

# Integrated Evolutionary Algorithm

The affordance system and meta-programming functions in CX allow the
flexibility of changing the program's structure in a supervised
manner. However, affordances can still be automated by having a
function that selects the index of the affordance to be applied.

`evolve` is a native function that constructs user-defined functions
by using random affordances. An iterative process is used to test

`evolve` follows the principles of evolutionary computation. In
particular, evolve performs a technique called genetic
programming. Genetic programming tries to find a combination of
operators and arguments that will solve a problem. For example, you
could instruct `evolve` to find a combination of operators that, when
sent 10 as an argument, returns 20. This might sound trivial, but
genetic programming and other evolutionary algorithms can solve very
complicated problems.

In the *examples* directory from the repository, one can find an
example (*examples/evolving-a-function.cx*) that describes the process for
evolving a
[curve-fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting) function.

# Serialization

A program in CX can be partially or fully serialized to a byte
array. This serialization capability allows a program to create a
program image (similar to
[system images](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_image)), where
the exact state at which the program was serialized is
maintained. This means that a serialized program can be deserialized,
and resume its execution later on. Serialiation can also be used to
create backups.

A CX program can leverage its integrated features to create some
interesting scenarios. For example, a program can be serialized to
create a backup of itself, and start an
[evolutionary algorithm](#integrated-evolutionary-algorithm) on one of
its functions. If the evolutionary algorithm finds a function that
performs better than the previous definition, one can keep this new
version of the program. However, if the evolutionary algorithm
performed badly, the program can be restored to the saved backup. All
of these tasks can be automated.
