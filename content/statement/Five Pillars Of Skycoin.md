The Skycoin project is a hermetically contained software/application platform,
that operates in parallel to and on top of but independently of the existing
internet.

The five pillars of the Skycoin project are:

(1) [Skycoin](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin), a coin that is better than
   Bitcoin in every way technically:

 - Transactions faster than credit card instead of an hour.
 - Unlimited transaction rate.
 - No need for miners and block rewards.
 - Low power usage.
 - All the problems in the cryptography are fixed (e.g. signature malleability).
 - A consensus mechanism superior to anything that exists
   ([Obelisk](/statement/obelisk-the-skycoin-consensus-algorithm/)).

(2) [Skywire](/tags/skywire/), a mesh network, where you can get coins for
   forwarding traffic/bandwidth. This is a similar to Tor or BitTorrent,
   except that you will be paid to run node.

(3) [Skyledger](https://www.skyledger.net), a platform that is our version of
   Ethereum's ERC20, but is better:

 - We give every coin their own blockchain and the platform runs on top of the
   Skywire infrastructure, and we get a fee from that.
 - We have a programming language ([CX](/overview/cx-overview/)),
   not "smart contracts" (which we think is total bullshit).
 - We let the developers of each chain hardcode whatever they want to do.

(4) An ecosystem of apps being built on top of the previous three things.

 - [Sky-messenger](http://messenger.skycoin.net/)
 - [Distributed social media (BBS)](https://github.com/skycoin/bbs))
   which is sort of like Steemit, but on our infrastructure and platform.
 - File-sharing/dropbox type functionality

(5) Our own [hardware platform](/statement/skywire-miner-hardware-for-the-next-internet/).
