## Intructive Guide on How to Purchase Skycoin

We have received a lot of messages asking for explicit directions on how to purchase Skycoin, so we are making this blog post to outline the process. There are currently three ways to purchase Skycoin. You can purchase on the exchanges C2CX, Cryptopia, or Over-The-Counter.
The Over-The-Counter Exchange is currently sold out, so you can purchase Skycoin on https://www.c2cx.com/in/home or https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/. To purchase on these two exchanges, you will need to buy Bitcoin. You can purchase Bitcoin at https://www.coinbase.com/, https://gemini.com/, https://www.bitstamp.net/, or other verified exchanges. 

After you purchase Bitcoin, you will need to transfer your Bitcoin to Cryptopia or C2CX to purchase Skycoin. To do this, you will need to first make an account on either of these exchanges. After making your account, you will need to copy the Bitcoin address from your C2CX or Cryptopia balances tab. This is the address you will send Bitcoin to. Now, go to the original exchange where you purchased Bitcoin, i.e. Coinbase, Gemini, or Bitstamp, and access the send function from your Bitcoin wallet. You will copy and paste the Cryptopia or C2CX address into the send page of the original exchange. After you do this, you should be able to send and confirm the transaction. If you want to view your transaction, you can do so at https://blockchain.info/ by looking up the associated public addresses that you used. Now, you will have to wait for the Bitcoin to arrive at your address at C2CX or Cryptopia. This time can vary from minutes to hours depending on how clogged the Bitcoin blockchain is. After it arrives, you will be able to purchase Skycoin on the exchange. To do so, you will need to access the SKY tab of the exchange page and place an order to bid at a certain price, or match a corresponding sell order on the exchange. If you have further questions you can contact the Skycoin team at t.me/Skycoin or contact@Skycoin.net.
