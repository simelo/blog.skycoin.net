Skycoin and Skywire are two separate components of the Skycoin Project.
Skycoin is the blockchain. Skywire is the [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking).

Skycoin was built first. It can stand on its own. It was created to address
problems that Bitcoin has. The biggest problem that Bitcoin has is mining,
which leads to the centralization of Bitcoin. The other problems that Bitcoin
had mostly related to cryptography or software bugs, leading to problems such
as [transaction malleability](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability).

Skycoin developed a new consensus algorithm called [Obelisk](https://www.skycoin.net/whitepapers)
that eliminates mining (or other alternatives such as
[Proof-of-Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake)).
This is what the [whitepapers](https://www.skycoin.net/whitepapers) are about.
The consensus algorithm uses a web-of-trust mechanism to secure the network.
Each node in the network has a small listed of trusted peers.
You share blocks with each other. If there's bad blocks, such as a block that
contains a [double spend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending),
you reject it and so do your trusted peers. There can be many malicious
nodes in the network, but it will have no impact if you do not trust them.

Skywire was developed to address problems with the internet itself. There are
many [attack points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking) especially
for governments since they have large control over the infrastructure.
But also large ISPs are pretty bad to their customers.
All of these problems are due to the centralization of the internet.

Skywire itself can operate without Skycoin. It would not be the first meshnet
software out there. There have been several attempts at building meshnets
but none of them have grown very large, because it has been an all-volunteer effort.
By integrating Skycoin with Skywire, individuals can earn money for running
the internet, instead of large ISPs. This is the only sustainable path for
democratizing the internet infrastructure. In addition, the skywire network has
much higher security and privacy than the current internet.

Any kind of application that works over the internet, can also work over
Skywire. Videos, file storage, VPNs, all of it. Using Skywire will be free,
but users can pay nodes in the network for forwarding their traffic, to receive
better bandwidth and priority service. This provides long term demand for
Skycoins. Initially, the Skycoin Project will use some of the undistributed
coins to subsidize operators of nodes on the Skywire network, to get it going.
Over time, the subsidy will be replaced by users drawn to the network for the
applications that run over Skywire.

The Skycoin blockchain and the Skywire network are able to stand on their own
without the other, but mutually benefit together.  Skywire provides a utility
purpose for Skycoins, and Skycoin provides a financial incentive to expand the
Skywire network.
