## Translations

Translate posts from this blog.

Accepted languages are:

* Deutsch
* Español
* 日本語
* 한국어
* Ελληνικά
* Français
* Português
* Italiano

*Note: 中文 and Рyсский translations all have someone working on them now*

We may add more languages later but aren't able to verify translations for other languages yet.

At the bottom of each English-language blog post, the reward for that article is shown.

The post must not already be translated.

If a post is already translated but you find mistakes or improvement, we can give a small reward as appropriate.

One or two other native speakers of the translated language must review the translation to check its quality.
Bad translations will not receive a bounty, although you are free to improve it until it is accepted.

Instructions for submitting translations to the github are here: https://github.com/skycoin/blog/files/1469162/github-translation-manual.pdf

## Writing

* Negotiable based on views, publishing outlet, quality.
* Contact us ahead of time until we establish a way to value written content.

If something appears to be done in bad faith we may reject or reduce the reward (for example, fake youtube views or sloppy infographics).
