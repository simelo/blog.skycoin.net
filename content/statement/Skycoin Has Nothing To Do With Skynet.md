Recently we have been asked about other projects called "Skynet" or "Superskynet".

Skycoin has never used the name "Skynet" because it is clich√© and unoriginal.

Furthermore, we are opposed to what "skynet" from the Terminator movie represents:
the subjugation of humanity to machines controlled by the few.

The Skycoin Project has no relationship with projects called "Skynet".
